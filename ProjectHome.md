Functionality implemented into system:

Search Algorithms
> Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Recursive Depth Limited Search, Iterative Deepening Search, Simulated Annealing, Hill Climbing, A Star, Greedy Best First Search

UI
> The “Bin” in which the blocks will be placed
> Options to choose how many of each tetromino will need to be placed in the “Bin”.
> An option to randomly generate a starting problem set of tetrominos
> An option to start the search algorithm.
> Options to set height and width of bin

Model
> Bin – a rectangular 2 Dimensional bin in which pieces are added at the top
> Tetrominos – may be rotated and placed on floor or on top of another piece. An open source tetris game will be used for its tetris board and tetromino classe
